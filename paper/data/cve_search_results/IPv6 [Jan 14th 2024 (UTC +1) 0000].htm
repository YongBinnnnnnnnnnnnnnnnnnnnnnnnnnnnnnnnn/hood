		<td valign="top">An Unsupported Feature in the UI vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and EX9200 Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause partial impact to the integrity of the device. If the "tcp-reset" option is added to the "reject" action in an IPv6 filter which matches on "payload-protocol", packets are permitted instead of rejected. This happens because the payload-protocol match criteria is not supported in the kernel filter causing it to accept all packets without taking any other action. As a fix the payload-protocol match will be treated the same as a "next-header" match to avoid this filter bypass. This issue doesn't affect IPv4 firewall filters. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and EX9200 Series: * All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S7; * 21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S5; * 21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S5; * 21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S4; * 21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4; * 22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S2; * 22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S2; * 22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3; * 22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R1-S2, 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3.

If a specific IPv4 UDP packet is received and sent to the Routing Engine (RE) packetio crashes and restarts which causes a momentary traffic interruption. Continued receipt of such packets will lead to a sustained DoS. This issue does not happen with IPv6 packets. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L: * 21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S6-EVO; * 22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S5-EVO; * 22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R2-S1-EVO, 22.2R3-EVO; * 22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R2-EVO.

		<td valign="top">In pf packet processing with a 'scrub fragment reassemble' rule, a packet containing multiple IPv6 fragment headers would be reassembled, and then immediately processed. That is, a packet with multiple fragment extension headers would not be recognized as the correct ultimate payload. Instead a packet with multiple IPv6 fragment headers would unexpectedly be interpreted as a fragmented packet, rather than as whatever the real payload is. As a result, IPv6 fragments may bypass pf firewall rules written on the assumption all fragments have been reassembled and, as a result, be forwarded or processed by the host.

In versions 4.9 and prior, when processing the various IPv6 header fields during IPHC header decompression, Contiki-NG confirms the received packet buffer contains enough data as needed for that field. But no similar check is done before decompressing the IPv6 address. Therefore, up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds on the line with the statement `memcpy(&amp;ipaddr-&gt;u8[16 - postcount], iphc_ptr, postcount);`. The value of `postcount` depends on the address compression used in the received packet and can be controlled by the attacker. As a result, an attacker can inject a packet that causes an out-of-bound read. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available. As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2509 to patch the system.

This issue affects every version of OpenComputers with the Internet Card feature enabled; that is, OpenComputers 1.2.0 until 1.8.3 in their most common, default configurations. If the OpenComputers mod is installed as part of a Minecraft server hosted on a popular cloud hosting provider, such as AWS, GCP and Azure, those metadata services' API endpoints are not forbidden (aka "blacklisted") by default. As such, any player can gain access to sensitive information exposed via those metadata servers, potentially allowing them to pivot or privilege escalate into the hosting provider. In addition, IPv6 addresses are not correctly filtered at all, allowing broader access into the local IPv6 network. This can allow a player on a server using an OpenComputers computer to access parts of the private IPv4 address space, as well as the whole IPv6 address space, in order to retrieve sensitive information. OpenComputers v1.8.3 for Minecraft 1.7.10 and 1.12.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are also available. One may disable the Internet Card feature completely. If using OpenComputers 1.3.0 or above, using the allow list (`opencomputers.internet.whitelist` option) will prohibit connections to any IP addresses and/or domains not listed; or one may add entries to the block list (`opencomputers.internet.blacklist` option). More information about mitigations is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

When reading the TCP MSS option value from an incoming packet, the Contiki-NG OS does not verify that certain buffer indices to read from are within the bounds of the IPv6 packet buffer, uip_buf. In particular, there is a 2-byte buffer read in the module os/net/ipv6/uip6.c. The buffer is indexed using 'UIP_IPTCPH_LEN + 2 + c' and 'UIP_IPTCPH_LEN + 3 + c', but the uip_buf buffer may not have enough data, resulting in a 2-byte read out of bounds. The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in release 4.9. Users are advised to watch for the 4.9 release and to upgrade when it becomes available.

The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS), which is used to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes, a given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state. The message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually be created for the indicated address. The resulting pointer is used without a check, leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer of type `uip_ds6_nbr_t`.

		<td valign="top">Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. The 6LoWPAN implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system (file os/net/ipv6/sicslowpan.c) contains an input function that processes incoming packets and copies them into a packet buffer. Because of a missing length check in the input function, it is possible to write outside the packet buffer's boundary. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who has the possibility to send 6LoWPAN packets to a Contiki-NG system. In particular, the vulnerability is exposed when sending either of two types of 6LoWPAN packets: an unfragmented packet or the first fragment of a fragmented packet. If the packet is sufficiently large, a subsequent memory copy will cause an out-of-bounds write with data supplied by the attacker.

		<td valign="top">Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. The low-power IPv6 network stack of Contiki-NG has a buffer module (os/net/ipv6/uipbuf.c) that processes IPv6 extension headers in incoming data packets. As part of this processing, the function uipbuf_get_next_header casts a pointer to a uip_ext_hdr structure into the packet buffer at different offsets where extension headers are expected to be found, and then reads from this structure. Because of a lack of bounds checking, the casting can be done so that the structure extends beyond the packet's end. Hence, with a carefully crafted packet, it is possible to cause the Contiki-NG system to read data outside the packet buffer. A patch that fixes the vulnerability is included in Contiki-NG 4.8.

Because of insufficient validation of IPv6 neighbor discovery options in Contiki-NG, attackers can send neighbor solicitation packets that trigger an out-of-bounds read.

In particular, this problem can occur when attempting to read the 2-byte option header and the Source Link-Layer Address Option (SLLAO). This attack requires ipv6 be enabled for the network. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG. The upcoming 4.8 release of Contiki-NG will include the patch.Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1654.

When the issue occurs, traffic is not discarded as desired, which can be observed by comparing the Input bytes with the Output bytes using the following command: user@junos&gt; monitor interface traffic Interface Link Input bytes (bps) Output bytes (bps) ge-0/0/0 Up 37425422 (82616) 37425354 (82616) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; egress ge-0/0/1 Up 37425898 (82616) 37425354 (82616) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ingress The expected output, with input and output counters differing, is shown below: Interface Link Input bytes (bps) Output bytes (bps) ge-0/0/0 Up 342420570 (54600) 342422760 (54600) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; egress ge-0/0/1 Up 517672120 (84000) 342420570 (54600) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ingress This issue only affects IPv4 policing.

		<td valign="top">A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the device by sending certain crafted protocol packets from an adjacent device with invalid payloads to the device. These crafted packets, which should be discarded, are instead replicated and sent to the RE. Over time, a Denial of Service (DoS) occurs. Continued receipt of these crafted protocol packets will cause an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which may cause wider traffic impact due to protocol flapping. An indication of compromise is to check "monitor interface traffic" on the ingress and egress port packet counts. For each ingress packet, two duplicate packets are seen on egress. This issue can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 packets. This issue affects all traffic through the device.

		<td valign="top">An improper interpretation conflict of certain data between certain software components within the Juniper Networks Junos OS devices does not allow certain traffic to pass through the device upon receipt from an ingress interface filtering certain specific types of traffic which is then being redirected to an egress interface on a different VLAN. This causes a Denial of Service (DoS) to those clients sending these particular types of traffic. Such traffic being sent by a client may appear genuine, but is non-standard in nature and should be considered as potentially malicious, and can be targeted to the device, or destined through it for the issue to occur. This issues affects IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An indicator of compromise may be found by checking log files. You may find that traffic on the input interface has 100% of traffic flowing into the device, yet the egress interface shows 0 pps leaving the device. For example: [show interfaces "interface" statistics detail] Output between two interfaces would reveal something similar to: Ingress, first interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/0 Up 9999999999 (9999) 1 (0) -------------------- Egress, second interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/1 Up 0 (0) 9999999999 (0) -------------------- Dropped packets will not show up in DDoS monitoring/protection counters as issue is not caused by anti-DDoS protection mechanisms.

		<td valign="top">Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn before version 4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in version 4.5.2. As a workaround the addresses in the address block `0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be denied by default unless `--allow-loopback-peers` has been specified.

		<td valign="top">Specific IPv6 packets sent by clients processed by the Routing Engine (RE) are improperly handled. These IPv6 packets are designed to be blocked by the RE from egressing the RE. Instead, the RE allows these specific IPv6 packets to egress the RE, at which point a mbuf memory leak occurs within the Juniper Networks Junos OS device. This memory leak eventually leads to a kernel crash (vmcore), or the device hanging and requiring a power cycle to restore service, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. During the time where mbufs are rising, yet not fully filled, some traffic from client devices may begin to be black holed. To be black holed, this traffic must match the condition where this traffic must be processed by the RE. Continued receipt and attempted egress of these specific IPv6 packets from the Routing Engine (RE) will create an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Scenarios which have been observed are: 1. In a single chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang without vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario the device needs to be power cycled. 2. In a single chassis, dual RE scenario, the device master RE will fail over to the backup RE. In this scenario, the master and the backup REs need to be reset from time to time when they vmcore. There is no need to power cycle the device. 3. In a dual chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang without vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario, the two chassis' design relies upon some type of network level redundancy - VRRP, GRES, NSR, etc. - 3.a In a commanded switchover, where nonstop active routing (NSR) is enabled no session loss is observed. 4. In a dual chassis, dual chassis scenario, rely upon the RE to RE failover as stated in the second scenario. In the unlikely event that the device does not switch RE to RE gracefully, then the fallback position is to the network level services scenario in the third scenario.

		<td valign="top">In Weave Net before version 2.6.3, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service. In a cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it's pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them. By sending rogue router advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond. If by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year's RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host. Weave Net version 2.6.3 disables the accept_ra option on the veth devices that it creates.

		<td valign="top">It was discovered that the Western Digital My Cloud device before 2.30.196 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as an admin user without needing to provide a password, thereby gaining full control of the device. (Whenever an admin logs into My Cloud, a server-side session is created that is bound to the user's IP address. After the session is created, it is possible to call authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie username=admin in the HTTP request. The invoked CGI will check if a valid session is present and bound to the user's IP address.) It was found that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to create a valid session without a login. The network_mgr.cgi CGI module contains a command called "cgi_get_ipv6" that starts an admin session -- tied to the IP address of the user making the request -- if the additional parameter "flag" with the value "1" is provided. Subsequent invocation of commands that would normally require admin privileges now succeed if an attacker sets the username=admin cookie.

		<td valign="top">Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb-&gt;len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev-&gt;len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in e89e9cf539a2 ("[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach") on Oct 18 2005.

		<td valign="top">An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be employed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation) [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.
