\begin{abstract}
  Design and implementation of a firewall device based on Raspberry Pi.
  The firewall will use a new method to harden the SSL protocol. It is 
  designed for someone who would like to sacrifice some compatibility 
  to pursue better security but still wants some balance between 
  security and convenience. A sensitive target, like an investigative 
  journalist, could be a potential user of this device. The new method
  to enhance SSL security introduced in this article is widely 
  applicable to firewall designs.

\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this work is to increase the chance of survival of the user 
from hacking, evasdropping, and digital fingerprinting. The device will 
work as a strict firewall which limits network activities and will also
apply privacy enhancing technologies to reduce the attack surface of 
digital fingerprinting and it will also apply emerging technologies to 
increase the difficulty of eavesdropping. The device will run a SSL proxy 
to harden SSL protocol. It will use a screen to display selected real-time 
internet activities.\par
Using a hardware as a firewall has several advantages. Firstly, hardware 
firewall can provide complete isolation between highly unsafe code, 
like a browser, and firewall software (fun fact: I was hacked repeatedly 
through personally harddened latest version of firefox while writing this 
thesis). This could also work as a mitigation of CPU/BIOS level threats: 
Firmware malwares, bootkits, and doubtable proprietray technologies like 
Intel ME and the AMD PSP. Second, it will also provide convenience to the 
user: the configuration of this portable device will be applied to protect 
everything behind it, so people do not need to do the time consuming 
configuration work on different softwares and operating systems one by one. 
Even things that could not be configured will be under the limitation of 
the firewall. Not to mention that many things cannot be configured freely.
In example, people cannot untrust a built-in trusted root certificate from 
iPhone via Settings app.



\chapter{Comparsion to existing works}
\section{Commercial hardware}
Commercial firewalls are expensive. In switzerland, the price of a entry 
level firewall is more than twice of a raspberry pi. Raspberry Pi being
used in this work could be replaced with some cheaper alternatives, making 
the cost will be even lower. Commercial firewalls also do not provide a 
screen to display network activities in real-time.

\section{SSL proxy}
Unlike traditional MITM SSL proxy, the proxy used in this device will work 
in non-intrusive way which means it will not decrypt SSL sessions.

 \section{The second, math section}

\textbf{Theorem 1 (Residue Theorem).}
Let $f$ be analytic in the region $G$ except for the isolated singularities $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m$. If $\gamma$ is a closed rectifiable curve in $G$ which does not pass through any of the points $a_k$ and if $\gamma\approx 0$ in $G$ then
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma f = \sum_{k=1}^m n(\gamma;a_k) \text{Res}(f;a_k).
\]
\textbf{Theorem 2 (Maximum Modulus).}
\emph{Let $G$ be a bounded open set in $\mathbb{C}$ and suppose that $f$ is a continuous function on $G^-$ which is analytic in $G$. Then}
\[
\max\{|f(z)|:z\in G^-\}=\max \{|f(z)|:z\in \partial G \}.
\]

define something weird based on the BPEL specification
